# DenScript-Pixel-V1.1

The DenScript Pixel uses the commonly available WS2812B Addressable RGB LED, which can produce over 16,000,000 colours! Perfect for when you want more LEDs than your Microcontroller can handle.

Rather than taking a current to control the Red, Green and Blue electrodes of a standard RGB LED, the DenScript Pixel only requires a VCC (5V), GND and Data signal. Even better, you can theoretically chain an unlimited number of these together to make exciting LED Displays!!

To make connecting to the module easier, we have colour coded the pins, simply match the colours when connecting multiple Pixels together! The arrow at the base shows the direction of data travel.
